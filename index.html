    Learning to code also improves logical thinking and patience. When something does not
    work, I enjoy debugging and finding the mistake. Robotics and coding are important
    skills for the future, especially in areas like automation, artificial intelligence,
    and engineering.

  <h2>STEM in Robotics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Integrated Learning: </b>Unlike learning subjects in isolation, robotics connects them; for example, engineering the structure, coding the movement (Technology), calculating angles (Math), and using sensors (Science).</li>
    <li><b>Educational Goal: </b>It fosters skills like creativity, debugging, and logical thinking by turning theoretical knowledge into functional, physical, or virtual machines.</li>
    <li><b>Application: </b>It is widely used in education to teach coding, AI, and engineering principles through interactive projects like creating robots that navigate, pick up objects, or follow lines.</li>
    <li><b>Future-Ready Skills:</b>STEM robotics prepares individuals for future careers by developing critical skills in demand within high-tech industries. </li>
  </ul>
